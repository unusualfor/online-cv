career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I bridge the gap between technical depth and business value in cloud-native infrastructure.
      For 11+ years, I've designed Kubernetes-based platform architectures, led technical presales engagements,
      and driven partner and customer adoption of cloud-native solutions — from evaluation through production.
      Hands-on experience with Kubernetes and related solutions, such as Red Hat OpenShift and SUSE Rancher in carrier-grade environments, 
      including cluster architecture, deployment, and integration. Proven track record leading PoCs, technical workshops, and architecture 
      walkthroughs across EMEA, APAC, and US markets. Active O-RAN Alliance standards contributor 
      and conference speaker. Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) and Security Specialist (CKS).
